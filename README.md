# Hi, I'm Rodrigo 👋

### Backend Python · API integration · Library design

I work in backend Python, mainly integrating APIs, and I tend to avoid stacks of libraries that solve the same problem in slightly different ways.

I develop **Pure Python libraries**, without external dependencies, to replace fragmented workflows with a single, explicit model.
